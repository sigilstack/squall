# SQUALL RFC Series

This directory houses the formal Request for Comment (RFC) series for the SQUALL protocol and related systems.

The SQUALL RFCs define standards, practices, mechanisms, and philosophical underpinnings relevant to the design and implementation of the SQUALL message queuing system. RFCs serve as the authoritative source for protocol details, interoperability guidance, and long-term reference.

Each RFC is a versioned document with a unique number and descriptive title. Documents may be in one of the following statuses:

- **Draft** – Actively under discussion and subject to revision
- **Proposed** – Considered stable but not yet widely implemented
- **Final** – Approved and adopted as normative for the protocol
